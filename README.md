Project Title: Advanced Chatbot Interface
Description
This project presents an advanced chatbot interface designed to provide efficient and relevant responses by leveraging the power of Sentence Transformers for natural language understanding, ElasticSearch for fast and scalable search capabilities, FastAPI for creating a robust backend service, and Streamlit for a user-friendly frontend interface. The project includes detailed ElasticSearch operations for indexing and managing the data, ensuring that the chatbot can retrieve information quickly and accurately.

Components
Sentence Transformers: Utilized for encoding user queries into vector space, enabling semantic search capabilities.
ElasticSearch: Acts as the search engine backend, storing, and indexing the encoded sentences for fast retrieval.
FastAPI: Provides the backend framework, handling HTTP requests and integrating with ElasticSearch for query processing.
Streamlit: Powers the frontend, offering an interactive web interface for users to interact with the chatbot.
ElasticSearch Operations: Documented in a Jupyter Notebook (elastic_search_data_insertion.ipynb), detailing the indexing process and other search engine operations.
Project Structure
chatbot_frontend.py: Streamlit application script for the frontend.
main.py: FastAPI application entry point, handling backend logic and communication with ElasticSearch.
elastic_search_data_insertion.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with ElasticSearch indexing and data management operations.
sample_data.csv: Sample dataset used for populating the ElasticSearch index.
Setup and Installation
Prerequisites:

Python 3.8+
Docker (for ElasticSearch)
Node.js (optional for development purposes)
Installation:

bash
Copy code
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>

# Navigate to the project directory
cd <project-directory>

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
ElasticSearch Setup:

Ensure Docker is installed and running.
Pull and run the ElasticSearch Docker image:
bash
Copy code
docker pull docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.10.0
docker run -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 -e "discovery.type=single-node" docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.10.0
Use the elastic_search_data_insertion.ipynb notebook to index the sample data.
Running the Application:

Start the FastAPI backend:
bash
Copy code
uvicorn main:app --reload
Run the Streamlit frontend:
bash
Copy code
streamlit run chatbot_frontend.py
Usage:

Access the Streamlit interface at http://localhost:8501 to interact with the chatbot.
The FastAPI documentation and API endpoints can be accessed at http://localhost:8000/docs.
